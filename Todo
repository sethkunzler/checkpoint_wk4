9 Stretch Goals - 

Allow the user to set their name and have it save to localStorage

Change the message from Good Morning to Good Afternoon, Evening as appropriate

Allow the user to toggle the clock from, 12hr to 24hr

Include an Icon to show what the weather is sunny/cloudy/rainy hint look at the weather data

Add a button to cycle to next quote/picture

Add a settings so user can change to a new 'theme' (font, background colors, etc.)

Clicking the weather should let the user toggle between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin

If you think through some of the actions being performed you might find a way to optimize the list by only updating the one todo that changes at a time

Every time you update a todo you shouldn't have to re-get the entire list you already know what changed about the one todo
